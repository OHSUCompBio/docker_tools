Steps to get ANNOVAR working on Galaxy.

First register and download ANNOVAR to the machine, somewhere galaxy will be able to see an access it. 
Run the download commands for each of your desired databases. Example: "annotate_variation.pl -buildver hg19 -downdb -webfrom annovar refGene humandb/"
Recomend following the first few steps outlined at https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/startup/
Basically if the command you need to run involves the -downdb option, it needs to happen on the command line.
Note where you put the ANNOVAR program and the database files. 

Now install the ANNOVAR tool from the tool_shed.
To run the tool you will need to tell it where the ANNOVAR program lives and where the database files are.
